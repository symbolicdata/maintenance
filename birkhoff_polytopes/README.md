# Transformation Script for Birkhoff Polytope fingerprints

This transformation is a very first attempt to compile fingerprints from the
collection of Birkhoff polytopes at
http://polymake.org/polytopes/paffenholz/www/birkhoff.html.  

Feel free to adjust the transformation script.

The perl script BirkhoffPolytopes.pl can be run as-is. It reads the remote
Birkhoff files and compiles the desired fingerprints. 

The script was compiled by Andreas Nareike in March 2013.

The Birkhoff Polytope fingerprints are part of the SymbolicData data
collection, see http://symbolicdata.org/Data/BirkhoffPolytopes/.
